## Quickstart

### Run BCD

Clone this repo and cd in:
```
make gateway-images
make gateway
```

API gateway is now available at http://localhost:14000/v1/stats

Alternatively you can pull stable images:
```
make stable-pull
make stable-gateway
```

In order to stop or reset BCD:
```
make gateway-down
make gateway-clear
```

### Sandbox

Make sure your Tezos node is exposed at `0.0.0.0:8732`
```
make sandbox-images
make sandbox
```

Sandbox UI is now available at http://localhost:8000

You can also use a builtin Flextesa instance instead (will be exposed at 8732):
```
make flextesa-sandbox
```

In order to stop or reset sandbox:
```
make sandbox-down
make sandbox-clear
```

## About
This project is the successor of the first [serverless](https://github.com/baking-bad/better-call-dev) version (aka BCD1). It has been rewritten from scratch in Golang.   
Better Call Dev was initially funded and is currently supported by [Tezos Foundation](https://tezos.foundation/).
